# DNA-compression-using-Burrows-Wheeler-Transform
A Python-based implementation of DNA compression using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). Optimizes storage by rearranging DNA sequences for improved compressibility with optional MTF, RLE, or Huffman coding. Supports full decompression and is ideal for genomic data storage and bioinformatics use.
